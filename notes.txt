3️⃣ PROCESS & TECHNOLOGY SECTIONS
What is Plasma?

Fourth state of matter

Superheated ionized gas (e.g., lightning)

What is Plasma Gasification?

A high-temperature oxygen-starved process that:

Breaks waste into clean fuel (syngas)

Produces inert, non-toxic slag

Requires only minimal waste segregation

Has almost zero harmful emissions

Outputs Include:

Hydrogen-rich syngas

Electricity

Vitrified slag (usable in construction)

4️⃣ BENEFITS OF THE TECHNOLOGY (For Homepage or Info Page)

Eco-friendly waste disposal

95% waste diversion

No dioxins & furans (most carcinogenic)

Reduces greenhouse gases

Eliminates landfill dependency

Creates local employment

Slag usable as construction material

Supports circular economy

5️⃣ TECHNICAL DETAILS (For dedicated tech page)
Energy Conversion Efficiency

1 kg plastic → needs 1 kWe plasma power

Produces ~3.6 kWe energy output

Net recovery: 2.4 kWe (approx. ₹7 value)

Sensitivity Analysis

Plasma gas flow ↓ → syngas production ↓

MSW flow ↑ → syngas production ↑

Cold gas efficiency (CGE) is crucial

Goal: maximize energy, minimize cost

6️⃣ LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS FINDINGS

Plasma gasification has negative environmental impact values → very eco-friendly

CO₂ reduction: –31 kg per ton of MSW

Waste reduction efficiency: 86%

Low residue: 15 kg/ton vs 40+ kg/ton from incineration

Outperforms incineration in sustainability

Design the website using the “Bio-Industrial Fusion” theme.
Use brushed steel and charcoal backgrounds, with copper gradients for accents and lines.
Use forest green and moss green for nature elements.
Blend geometric machinery shapes with faint organic leaf-vein overlays.
All cards and panels should have a steel texture with thin copper borders.
Typography should be bold, industrial, and modern.
Add subtle green glows to represent ‘clean energy’.
Buttons must be copper gradient with green hover glows.
Use hexagon or circular industrial diagrams for process flows.
Hero section should have a diagonal copper streak across a dark steel background with green particle animation.

more notes, that i found after consulting another ai

Here’s a prompt you can feed your AI (or use yourself) to generate the required code for this menu/scroll/full-screen style. I’ve broken it down into detailed specs so the AI has all the directions it needs.

---

**Prompt for the AI coder:**

> Build a web page (or template) using HTML + CSS + JavaScript (or your preferred frontend stack) that replicates the following behaviour, replacing videos with images:
>
> **1. Basic layout & global styling**
>
> * The page has a vertical scrollable main content area.
> * A persistent header/menu bar at the top with a breadcrumb style structure: e.g., “Home / Section” (or similar) that shows the current section.
> * The menu bar is clickable: when a menu item is clicked (in the header), it scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section further down the page.
> * Each section is full-width and full-height of viewport (or near that) so that when you scroll (or click), you land in a major section.
> * Use transitions/animations for smooth scroll behaviour.
>
> **2. Menu & full-screen overlay menu**
>
> * In the header, include a “hamburger” or menu trigger icon. When clicked, it opens a **full-screen overlay menu page** (an overlay that covers the whole viewport).
> * In that overlay menu, display navigation links (for the same sections). Each link occupies say a row or block.
> * When the overlay is open, hovering over a link should display (instead of videos) **a large background image change** (or image preview) behind (or in) the menu overlay—so when you hover over Link A, the background image changes to Image A; hover over Link B → Image B; etc.
> * The overlay menu has a close button to go back to the main content.
>
> **3. Section links + smooth scroll**
>
> * For each major section on the main page (e.g., Section “Energy”, “Critical Materials”, etc.), when the user clicks the item in the header breadcrumb/menu, the page should scroll down (or up) to that section's content.
> * The breadcrumb in the header should update to reflect which section is currently in view (on scroll or click).
>
> **4. Replace “video on hover” with “image on hover”**
>
> * In the overlay menu, instead of playing a video when you hover over each link, show a full-screen image (or large background image) corresponding to that link.
> * The image change should be smooth (fade in/out) as you hover between links.
>
> **5. Responsive & accessibility**
>
> * Ensure the layout works on desktop and mobile (overlay menu, full-screen images, scroll behaviour).
> * Include ARIA tags or semantic markup for accessibility (menu open/close, focus states).
>
> **6. Implementation details**
>
> * Use CSS variables or a theme so images and sections can be swapped easily.
> * Use `scroll-behavior: smooth;` (or JS fallback) for scrolling.
> * Use Intersection Observer or scroll event to detect which section is in view and update the breadcrumb/menu highlight.
> * Use `position: fixed;` for header so it stays when scrolling.
> * For the overlay menu: apply `position: fixed; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; z-index:1000;` and transitions for opening/closing.
> * For hover-image effect: when menu is open, on each link hover you change a background image of the overlay container (e.g., via CSS `background-image` change or JS swapping an `<img>`). Use `transition: opacity .3s;` or similar.
>
> **7. Example structure in code**
>
> ```html
> <header>
>   <nav class="breadcrumb">
>     <a href="#home">Home</a> / <a href="#section1">Section1</a> / …  
>   </nav>
>   <button class="menu-trigger">☰</button>
> </header>
> <div id="overlayMenu" class="overlay-menu">
>   <button class="close-btn">×</button>
>   <ul class="menu-links">
>     <li data-image="img1.jpg"><a href="#section1">Section1</a></li>
>     <li data-image="img2.jpg"><a href="#section2">Section2</a></li>
>     …  
>   </ul>
>   <div class="hover-preview"></div>
> </div>
> <main>
>   <section id="section1">…content…</section>
>   <section id="section2">…content…</section>
>   …  
> </main>
> ```
>
> **CSS/JS cues**
>
> * `.overlay-menu` hidden by default, visible when menu triggered.
> * `.hover-preview` covers overlay background and updates its `background-image` based on hovered link’s `data-image`.
> * On scroll, update the breadcrumb nav active link.
> * On link click in breadcrumb or overlay, `event.preventDefault()` and scroll to the target using `element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`.
>
> **8. Replaceable parts**
>
> * Provide a map/object of link → image mapping so the images can be easily changed.
> * Provide placeholders for sections so content can be replaced.
>
> **9. Title, comments and code organisation**
>
> * At top of the JS file include comment: “Menu scroll + full-screen overlay menu with image-on-hover effect.”
> * Include comments guiding where to plug in your images, sections.
>
> **10. Deliverables**
>
> * Provide the HTML skeleton, CSS styles, and JS logic.
> * Ensure no external dependencies other than maybe one library (optional) but try vanilla JS/CSS if possible.
> * Ensure the code is modular and clear so you can reuse components.
>
> **Optional enhancements (if you like)**
>
> * Debounce scroll events to optimize.
> * Use CSS clip-path or mask to animate overlay open/close.
> * Use lazy-load for images if many.
> * On mobile, consider swipe gesture to close overlay.
>
> ---
>
> Please generate the full code (HTML + CSS + JS) according to the above specification.

If you like, I can **also generate a ready-to-use code scaffold** (files + folder structure) right now based on that prompt, so you can plug in your images and sections. Would you like me to do that, Lord Freiza?
